      "description": "This command is similar to \"rush rebuild\", except that \"rush build\" performs an incremental build. In other words, it only builds projects whose source files have changed since the last successful build. The analysis requires a Git working tree, and only considers source files that are tracked by Git and whose path is under the project folder. (For more details about this algorithm, see the documentation for the \"package-deps-hash\" NPM package.) The incremental build state is tracked in a per-project folder called \".rush/temp\" which should NOT be added to Git. The build command is tracked by the \"arguments\" field in the \"package-deps_build.json\" file contained therein; a full rebuild is forced whenever the command has changed (e.g. \"--production\" or not).",
